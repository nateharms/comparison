n-Heptane, Detailed Mechanism, Version 3.1

This mechanism represents an updated release of the previous version 
available on the website (Version 3.0). The mechanism is based on the 
previously developed and very successful mechanism of Curran et al. 
1998 [1]. Version 3.1 fixes some bugs found in Version 3.0. This 
detailed chemical kinetic mechanism has been developed and validated 
by comparison to experiments in shock tubes and rapid compression 
machines. Over the series of experiments numerically investigated, 
the initial pressure ranged from 3 to 50 atm, the temperature from 
650 to 1200 K, and equivalence ratios from 0.3 to 1.0. The mechanism 
performs well at both low and high temperature and over a broad 
pressure range important for internal combustion engines.

Abstract
========================
Real fuels are complex mixtures of thousands of hydrocarbon compounds 
including linear and branched paraffins, naphthenes, olefins and 
aromatics. It is generally agreed that their behavior can be effectively 
reproduced by simpler fuel surrogates containing a limited number of components.

In this work, an improved version of the kinetic model by the 
authors is used to analyze the combustion behavior of several 
components relevant to gasoline surrogate formulation. Particular 
attention is devoted to linear and branched saturated hydrocarbons 
(PRF mixtures), olefins (1-hexene) and aromatics (toluene). Model 
predictions for pure components, binary mixtures and multi-component 
gasoline surrogates are compared with recent experimental information 
collected in rapid compression machine, shock tube and jet stirred 
reactors covering a wide range of conditions pertinent to internal 
combustion engines (3–50 atm, 650–1200 K, stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures). 
Simulation results are discussed focusing attention on the mixing effects of the fuel components.
